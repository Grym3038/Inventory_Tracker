        <p class="pb-2">We're a small team passionate about helping businesses stay organized and efficient.
             Our goal is to make inventory tracking simple, accurate, and accessibleâ€”whether you're managing
             a local shop or keeping track of office supplies.</p>
        <p class="pb-2">This system was developed as part of a project to learn and apply real-world programming skills
             using PHP, Tailwind CSS, and SQL. We focused on practical features like low-stock alerts, product search,
             and user access levels to create a tool that solves real problems.</p>
        <p class="pb-2">Thank you for checking us out! We're excited to keep improving and adding more features to help businesses thrive.</p>
